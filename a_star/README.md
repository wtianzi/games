# A* Grid Game

🚀 Play it here: [wtianzi.github.io/games/a_star](https://wtianzi.github.io/games/a_star/)

A lightweight HTML5 + JavaScript game that visualizes A* pathfinding in real time. Your goal is to **trap or slow down the robot** (green square) before it reaches the goal (red square) by placing walls (black blocks) on the grid.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Start Point**: Blue square (top-left)
- **Goal**: Red square (bottom-right)
- **Robot**: Green square
- **Walls**: Black squares (placed by player)
- **Path**: Purple trail showing A* result

### Controls

- 🖱️ **Click or tap and drag** to place walls.
- ⏯️ **Pause/Resume** the simulation anytime.
- 🔄 **Reset** to start a new game.
- 📱 Fully responsive – works on both desktop and mobile!

### Victory & Defeat

- 🟢 **You Win**: The robot is completely blocked or slowed down enough.
- 🔴 **You Lose**: The robot reaches the goal.
- ❌ **No Path**: If a path no longer exists to the goal, you win!

Your final **score** is calculated based on how effectively you used walls and how many steps the robot took.
