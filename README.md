# 🕹️ Tianzi's Web Game Collection

Welcome to my collection of lightweight, browser-based games built with **HTML5** and **JavaScript**. This project is focused on fun, logic-based mini-games that run directly in the browser—no installs, no frameworks required.

## 🌟 Featured Game

### 🔷 [A* Grid Game](./a_star/)  
🧠 **A* Pathfinding Visualization + Strategy Game**

Play it here: [wtianzi.github.io/games/a_star](https://wtianzi.github.io/games/a_star/)

In this logic-based puzzle game, your task is to **trap or slow down a robot** using walls while it finds its path to the goal using the A* algorithm. Great for learning and fun for experimenting with grid-based strategy.

Features:
- Real-time A* visualization
- Mouse and touch interaction
- Responsive canvas for mobile and desktop
- Dynamic scoring and win/lose detection

For more details, see the [`a_star/README.md`](./a_star/README.md).
